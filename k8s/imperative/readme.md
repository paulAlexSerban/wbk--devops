# Kubernetes Imperative
- Examples: `kubectl run`, `kubectl create deployment`, `kubectl update`
  - we start with the state we know, no deployment exists
  - we ask `kubectl` to create a deployment
- different commands are required to change that deployment
- different commands are required per object
- imperative is easier when you know the state
- imperative is easier to get started
- imperative is easier for humans at the CLI
- imperative is not easy to automate
